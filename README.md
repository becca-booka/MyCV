## **Level_3, Task_05 - HyperionDev Software Engineer Bootcamp**
### ***Compulsory_Task_2

#### _**Description**_
In this task we had to create a CV-like webpage using html and CSS and then upload it to this repository on github. I reused code from task 16 of level 2 - for that task we had to decorate the webpage we had built with html in the previous task using CSS. The goal of task 16 was to introduce us to CSS, and the goal of this task, task 05 of levle 3, was to teach us how to upload and deploy files via github.
